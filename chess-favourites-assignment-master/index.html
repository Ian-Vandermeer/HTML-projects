    <h1>FAVOURITE CHESS PIECES</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <h2>The Pawn</h2>
    
    <p> <strong>The Pawn</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability to 
        work with other pawns and to become <em>promoted</em>.  Pawn chains can be 
         very powerful and a pawn can be promoted to another piece if it  
         reaches the other side of the chess board.</p>

    <h3>The Knight</h3>

    <p><strong>The Knight</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its unique L-shaped movement and ability to <em>jump over other pieces</em>.  It is impossible to block a Knight.</p>

    <h4>The Queen</h4>

    <p><strong>The Queen</strong> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its power.  The Queen can move <em>any number of spaces in any direction!</em></p>
